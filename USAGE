Usage
=====

Invoke kamusi preferably via

    $ rlwrap perl kamusi

When you simply enter a word, kamusi will output all matching words in
the currently selected language together with their meaning and
further descriptions.

There are some simple commands, all of them beginning with a dot (.),
to control kamusi's behaviour.

  Command       Meaning
  =======       =======
  .en           swith the search language en->sw [this is the startup default]
  .sw           swith the search language sw->en
  .v            toggle verbose output [default: off]
  .t [TYPE]     display only results of type TYPE, where TYPE is on of [1]
                ommitting TYPE is equal to allowing all types be displayed.
  .ex           toggle the display of examples if provided [default: on]
  .q            quit kamusi; you can also achieve this with Ctrl-C


[1] the most common types are: adjective, adverb, noun, verb; to
    obtain a full list of types available, issue the following command:
    $ grep Part\ of sall.txt | cut -d' ' -f4 | sort | uniq -c | sort -bgr
