Usage
=====

Invoke kamusi preferably via

    $ rlwrap perl kamusi

When you simply enter a word, kamusi will output all matching words in
the currently selected language together with their meaning and
further descriptions.

There are some simple commands, all of them beginning with a dot (.),
to control kamusi's behaviour.

  Command       Meaning
  =======       =======
  .en           switch the search language en->sw [this is the startup default]
  .sw           switch the search language sw->en
  .v            toggle verbose output [default: off]
  .t [TYPE]     display only results of type TYPE, where TYPE is on of [1]
                omitting TYPE is equal to allowing all types be displayed.
  .ex           toggle the display of examples if provided [default: on]
  .q            quit kamusi; you can also achieve this with Ctrl-C

Wildcards and Verb Prefixes
===========================

As of now, use the standard SQL wild cards (% for arbitrary match). Note that
most verbs are in fact available with a leading hyphen only, so searching for
the meaning of "nililia", you should precede the verb root with a hyphen: -lia.

Example Run
===========

Let's take an example: you occasionally hear people shouting something along
the lines of "nia".

    kamusi> .sw
    now searching sw -> en.
    kamusi> .ex
    example output turned off.
    kamusi> %nia
        [ .. lots of output ... ]
    kamusi> .t phrase
    will only display results of type 'phrase'.
    kamusi> %nia
    phrase: nia = {{ it is clear }}
    phrase: -ning'inia = {{ I have }}
    phrase: -tania = {{ it is beyond his strength }}

So there, you found it! :-)

[1] the most common types are: adjective, adverb, noun, verb; to
    obtain a full list of types available, issue the following command:
    $ grep Part\ of sall.txt | cut -d' ' -f4 | sort | uniq -c | sort -bgr
