Usage
=====

Invoke kamusi preferably via

    $ rlwrap perl kamusi

When you simply enter a word, kamusi will output all matching words in
the currently selected language together with their meaning and
further descriptions.

There are some simple commands, all of them beginning with an underscore (_),
to control kamusi's behaviour. You can also set these parameters
beforehand, via command line options. (Multiple options can be
combined, thus `kamusi -svd sw' will toggle [turn on] squashing,
verbose mode and switch the direction to sw->en.)

Switch  Command       Meaning
======  =======       =======
-d en   _en           swith the search language en->sw [this is the startup default]
-d sw   _sw           swith the search language sw->en
-v      _v            toggle verbose output [default: off]
-t VAL  _t [TYPE]     display only results of type TYPE, where TYPE is on of [1]
                      ommitting TYPE is equal to allowing all types be displayed.
-s      _sq           Toggle squashing [for each type of word, all matches will
                      be displayed in on long line, separated by a ';'. default: off]
-E      _ex           toggle the display of examples if provided [default: on]
        _q            quit kamusi; you can also achieve this with Ctrl-C or Ctrl-D

Wildcards and Verb Prefixes
===========================

As of now, use the standard SQL wild cards (% for arbitrary match). Note that
most verbs are in fact available with a leading hyphen only, so searching for
the meaning of "nililia", you should precede the verb root with a hyphen: -lia.

Example Run
===========

Let's take an example: you occasionally hear people shouting something along
the lines of "nia".

    kamusi> _sw
    now searching sw -> en.
    kamusi> _ex
    examples turned off
    kamusi> %nia
        [ .. lots of output ... ]
    kamusi> _t phrase
    will only display results of type 'phrase'.
    kamusi> %nia
    phrase: nia = {{ it is clear }}
    phrase: -ning'inia = {{ I have }}
    phrase: -tania = {{ it is beyond his strength }}

So there, you found it! :-)

Batch/Query mode
================

You might want to invoke this script non-interactively[2]. That's no problem,
just type your lookup string after the command line options like this:

    $ perl kamusi -sd sw -t verb %nia

[1] the most common types are: adjective, adverb, noun, verb; to
    obtain a full list of types available, issue the following command:
    $ grep Part\ of sall.txt | cut -d' ' -f4 | sort | uniq -c | sort -bgr
[2] An example use case is if you bind a small shell script to a
    specific key combination in your window manager. You might use a
    command like `xclip -o | xargs ~/bin/kamusi -s | notify-send' to
    open a little popup dialog for a few seconds, displaying all the
    possible meanings of the word you just selected in your web
    browser.
