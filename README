What is `kamusi'?
=================

"Kamusi" is the Kiswahili term for dictionary. Kamusi is a
command-line interface to the Kiswahili-English Dictionary provided
online at http://www.kamusi.org/. They have a fairly extensive list of
Kiswahili words, in part with attached examples and notes. The raw
data is freely available. This program converts the text files to a
SQLite database and provides a command-line interface to search for
words in that database.

Primarily I wrote this program to avoid loading times of the website
and use the keyboard more effectively. When I read Kiswahili texts or
write emails, I often keep a terminal open on a second screen to
quickly look up words.
