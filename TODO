TODO: improvements
==================

* Make location of `words.db' configurable and provide default paths to try:
  ./words.db, ~/.kamusi/words.db, /usr/share/kamusi/words.db

TODO: plans
===========

* improve wildcard support (* instead of %)
* do some heuristics on which words are more important in result
* maybe implement something pager-like (or mutt-like) when there are many results
  [possibible via internal or external pager in Term::Shell->page()]
* add vi mode
* allow to create "standalone" version by somehow encoding the sqlite db within the program file
