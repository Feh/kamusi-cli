How to determine whether a word is english or swahili?
Try to use some well-educated guesses to find out.

There are two certain cases:

* Word begins with a dash -> verb root -> swahili
* word contains q or x -> english word

All the other cases must somehow be classified (using some
deterministic scores for certain properties the word has) in order to
make a guess which language it is from.
