How to determine whether a word is english or swahili?
Try to use some well-educated guesses to find out.
[Does it consume too much resources to look up the word in the db and
make a guess based on the number of results returned?]

All the other cases must somehow be classified (using some
deterministic scores for certain properties the word has) in order to
make a guess which language it is from.

With current rules from guess_language.pl the detection rates are as
follows (found = detected correctly, fail = no decision, fp = false
positive):

English           Swahili
=======           =======

found: 28956      found: 18145
fail: 1838        fail: 3953
fp: 168           fp: 313
