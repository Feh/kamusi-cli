How to determine whether a word is english or swahili?
Try to use some well-educated guesses to find out.

There are two certain cases:

* Word begins with a dash -> verb root -> swahili
* Word contains ng' -> swahili
* word contains q or x -> english word

All the other cases must somehow be classified (using some
deterministic scores for certain properties the word has) in order to
make a guess which language it is from.

English
=======

* double consonants [allah?!]

Swahili
=======

* often: ^(-consonant{1,2}-vowel{1,2})+$

Actually, a pretty good test score seems to be to check for a vowel at the end:

zsh> wc -l swahili_words.txt
22411 swahili_words.txt
zsh> grep -ve '[aeiou]$' swahili_words.txt | wc -l
346

So only 1.5% of the words fail this test, and these are partly words
ending in punctuation, or directly from arabic.

Also, mw in a word is a pretty secure indicator that a word is
swahili. (Only six or so english words fail, and they are
unimportant).
